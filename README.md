mounted microhpone / broadcaster that can be paired with hearing aid
pair using RFID or ring qr / code facieal recognition?

old people scared of technology? they wouldn't have to know?


hearing aids commonly have a dongle around your neck with an aux prong,

DEVICE has an out that merges audio streams?


RECEIVER -> ROUTER /WIFI

HUB -> ROUTER /WIFI

Microphones directly wired to hub

FACES


Rings ? -> Tap with RFID to HUB

Something that sends data to facial recognition api> Python?
At low level RECEIVER has to have INPUT, not output
HUB -> CAMERA INPUT / OUTPUT to WIFI (audio)/ AUDIO input from microphones

On validation face to hub > hub broadcasts out a UDP packet containing RECEIVER ID, port, IP, to everything on network,
First receiver with that ID starts receiving audio from Hub,
